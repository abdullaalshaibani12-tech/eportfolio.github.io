							<h2> Unit 3: Agent Architecture</h2>
							<p> Unit 3 focused on agent-based systems and their practical applications. I learned to identify and critically analyse different agent-based architectures and approaches, understanding their strengths and limitations. The unit also emphasized the application of intelligent agent techniques to solve real-world problems, especially in scenarios involving technical risk and uncertainty, helping to evaluate solutions critically and make informed decisions. <br> <br>

Key Learnings:
<ul>
<li> Differentiation and critical analysis of agent-based architectures and approaches. </li>
<li> Application of intelligent agent techniques to real-world problems. </li>
<li> Critical evaluation of solutions in uncertain and high-risk environments. </li>
</ul>

							<h4> Summary Post </h4>
							<p> What i have learned in Discussion:

Through reviewing the discussion on Agent-Based Systems (ABS) and engaging with insights from peers, I have gained a clear understanding of how ABS function and their value for organisations. Agent Based System are autonomous entities capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning, and acting to achieve goals, which makes them distinct from traditional, centralised systems(Zuo, 2025). Their adaptability, scalability, and flexibility allow organisations to manage complex and dynamic processes in real time, making them useful in areas such as supply chains, finance, healthcare, and simulation modeling.

 I have learned from the feedback how ABS can improve operational efficiency and risk management, particularly in finance. They can process diverse datasets in real time, adjust to changing conditions, and make instant decisions, demonstrating the advantages of decentralised intelligence and automation(FAREA et al., 2024). I also appreciated the idea that ABS contribute to achieving larger goals through localised, autonomous decision-making, which is crucial in fast-paced, data-intensive industries.

 It has also broadened my understanding of ABS applications across multiple sectors. In supply chain management, they help companies monitor inventory, predict demand, and optimise logistics autonomously. In healthcare, ABS can simulate disease spread to guide resource allocation and intervention strategies. They are also applied in financial markets to model investor behaviour and in smart cities to optimise traffic, energy use, and emergency response(Quazi et al., 2024). 

Overall, these discussions have deepened my knowledge of ABS as versatile tools for decision-making, innovation, and risk management. I now understand how integrating ABS with AI and digital twins can further enhance predictive capabilities, efficiency, and strategic experimentation in complex organisations, positioning them as key drivers of innovation and adaptability. </p>
