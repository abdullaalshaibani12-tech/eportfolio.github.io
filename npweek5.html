<h2> Unit 5: Producing Plots and Introducing Calculus</h2>
              <p> Unit 5 explored how to create effective and meaningful visualisations in R, providing a foundation for presenting data clearly and accurately. I learned how R offers a wide range of packages designed for different graphical needs, each providing functions to produce various types of plots and charts. The unit also covered essential customisation techniques, such as naming plots, adding colour, incorporating text, and adjusting axes—skills that help enhance the clarity and interpretability of graphical outputs. <br><br> In addition to visualisation, the unit introduced the fundamentals of calculus, a mathematical tool frequently used in modelling and analysing continuous change. I learned the difference between differentiation—breaking changes into small parts to examine how a quantity varies—and integration, which combines small pieces to determine total amounts. These concepts are especially important in understanding curves such as the normal distribution and play a key role in analytical methods. The unit provided introductory guidance on how basic calculus operations can be applied within R (and Python). <br><br>
                Key Learnings: 
              <ul> 
                  <li> Understanding different types of graphs and plots and their purposes. </li> 
                <li> Using basic plot functions in R to create clear and informative graphics. </li>
                <li> Adjusting axes, colours, text, and sizing to customise and refine plots. </li> 
                <li> Gaining an introductory understanding of calculus, including differentiation and integration. </li>
                <li> Learning how calculus concepts and functions can be applied in R. </li> </ul>
