							<h2> Unit 1 : Introduction to Agent Based Computing</h2>
							<p> In Unit 1, the focus was on understanding intelligent agent systems and their applications. I learned how to identify and critically analyse agent-based systems by exploring different architectures and approaches. The unit highlighted the use of intelligent agent techniques in solving real-world problems, especially in situations involving technical risk and uncertainty. Additionally, I gained knowledge on deploying suitable software tools and skills for designing and implementing agent-based systems, while considering legal, social, ethical, and professional implications. <br>

Key Learnings:
<ul>
<li> Differentiation of agent-based architectures and approaches. </li>.
<li> Application of intelligent agent techniques in uncertain environments. </li>.
<li> Use of software tools for design and implementation. </li>
<li>Consideration of legal, ethical, and professional issues in system development.</li>
	
</ul>

							<h4> Discussion - Initial Post </h4>
							<p> The rise of agent-based systems has been driven by advances in artificial intelligence, distributed computing, and the growing need for adaptive, autonomous solutions in complex environments. Wooldridge argued that unlike traditional systems, agent-based systems consist of autonomous entities (“agents”) capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning, and acting to achieve goals. The increasing complexity of business processes, coupled with the demand for real-time decision-making, has made these systems particularly valuable in areas such as supply chain management, e-commerce, and simulation modeling (Wooldridge & Jennings, 1995).

One key driver is the scalability and flexibility of agent-based architectures, which allow organisations to model, predict, and optimise dynamic systems without centralised control (Bonabeau, 2002). Additionally, advances in networking and cloud computing have enabled agents to collaborate effectively across distributed platforms, enhancing efficiency and reducing operational bottlenecks.

The benefits for organisations include improved adaptability, as agents can learn and adjust to changing conditions; enhanced decision-making, through decentralised intelligence; and cost savings, due to automation of complex tasks (Jennings et al., 1998). In sectors like finance, healthcare, and logistics, these capabilities translate into more resilient, responsive, and innovative systems.</p> <br>
