							<h4> Peer Response </h4>
							<p> The rise of agent-based systems has been driven by advances in artificial intelligence, distributed computing, and the growing need for adaptive, autonomous solutions in complex environments. Wooldridge argued that unlike traditional systems, agent-based systems consist of autonomous entities (“agents”) capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning, and acting to achieve goals. The increasing complexity of business processes, coupled with the demand for real-time decision-making, has made these systems particularly valuable in areas such as supply chain management, e-commerce, and simulation modeling (Wooldridge & Jennings, 1995).

One key driver is the scalability and flexibility of agent-based architectures, which allow organisations to model, predict, and optimise dynamic systems without centralised control (Bonabeau, 2002). Additionally, advances in networking and cloud computing have enabled agents to collaborate effectively across distributed platforms, enhancing efficiency and reducing operational bottlenecks.

The benefits for organisations include improved adaptability, as agents can learn and adjust to changing conditions; enhanced decision-making, through decentralised intelligence; and cost savings, due to automation of complex tasks (Jennings et al., 1998). In sectors like finance, healthcare, and logistics, these capabilities translate into more resilient, responsive, and innovative systems.</p> <br>
