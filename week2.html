							<p> Hi Thiago,

This is a clear and well-explained discussion on the growth and strategic value of agent-based systems (ABS). I agree with your points about their autonomy, adaptability, and suitability for dynamic environments, especially in finance where speed and accuracy are critical. The credit scoring example effectively illustrates how ABS can process diverse datasets in real time, adapt to changing information, and make instant lending decisions, significantly improving operational efficiency and risk management(Hussain et al., 2024). I particularly like that you highlighted their ability to contribute to global goals through local decision-making, as this decentralised approach is a key advantage in fast-paced, data-heavy industries.

A suggestion to further strengthen this discussion is to include examples from supply chain management, where ABS are increasingly used to monitor inventory, predict demand fluctuations, and autonomously adjust procurement or logistics(Alonge et al., 2021). For instance, Amazon employs agent-based models to optimise warehouse operations, ensuring stock is available where needed while minimising overstock costs. This demonstrates how ABS can bring similar adaptability and efficiency benefits beyond finance(Chen, 2024). Overall, your analysis captures why ABS are becoming a strategic asset. Including cross-industry examples can further show their versatility and reinforce the argument for their adoption. </p>

							<p> Hi Hashim,

Great overview of Agent-Based Systems (ABS) and their organisational applications! To add to your points, ABS are increasingly applied across various industries to tackle complex, dynamic challenges. For instance, in supply chain management, agent-based models help simulate interactions among suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors(Khedr and Sheeja , 2024), enabling companies like Walmart to predict bottlenecks and optimise inventory levels. Similarly, in healthcare, ABS has been used to model the spread of diseases, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing policymakers to evaluate the impact of interventions and resource allocation before real-world implementation(Silva et al., 2020).

In financial markets, agent-based models simulate investor behaviours, helping to understand market dynamics, test regulatory policies, and predict systemic risks. Another interesting application is in smart cities, where autonomous agents represent vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure to optimise traffic flows, energy usage, and emergency response strategies(Elassy et al., 2024).

Beyond practical applications, ABS also support organisational learning. For example, multinational corporations like Siemens use agent-based simulations to test collaborative workflows in R&D projects, allowing teams to experiment with different decision-making strategies without disrupting real operations.

Overall, ABS provide a versatile, risk-free way to explore complex systems, understand emergent behaviours, and enhance decision-making across sectors.

Considering the integration of ABS with AI and digital twins, how do you see these technologies shaping decision-making and innovation in large, multi-stakeholder organisations over the next five years?. </p>
