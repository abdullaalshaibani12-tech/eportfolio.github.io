<h2>Unit 4: Probabilities, Probability Distributions, and Sampling</h2> 
              <p> Unit 4 introduced the fundamental concepts of probability and its essential role in data analysis. I learned how probability helps quantify the likelihood of events, providing a structured way to make informed decisions even when outcomes are uncertain. This unit emphasized how probability theory supports real-world business decision-making, especially in situations where complete information is unavailable. <br><br> A key focus of the unit was understanding both discrete and continuous probability distributions and how these mathematical functions describe the behaviour of random variables. I explored how discrete probability distributions can be applied to practical business scenarios to support evidence-based decision-making. <br><br> The unit also highlighted the importance of sampling in inferential statistics. Because collecting data from an entire population is often impractical, sampling methods—when applied appropriately—allow analysts to draw reliable and generalisable conclusions from smaller, representative subsets of data. <br><br> 
                
                Key Learnings:
              <ul> 
           <li> Understanding the basic principles of probability and its role in decision-making. </li> <li> Applying essential probability rules to real-world scenarios. </li> 
          <li> Recognising and interpreting discrete and continuous probability distributions. </li> <li> Using discrete probability distributions to address business-related problems. </li>
                <li> Exploring various sampling methods, including simple random, stratified random, systematic, and cluster sampling. </li>
