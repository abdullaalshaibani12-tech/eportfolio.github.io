							<h2> Unit 5: Agent Communication</h2>
							<p> Unit 5 focused on agent communication and the frameworks that enable agents to interact effectively. I learned about speech acts and speech act theory, which form the basis of meaningful communication between agents. The unit introduced agent communication languages, such as KQML, and discussed how these languages facilitate structured exchanges. Additionally, the concept of ontologies was explored, showing how they provide a shared understanding that supports agent communication. <br> <br>

Key Learnings:
<ul>
<li> Understanding speech acts and their role in communication. </li>
<li> Knowledge of ontologies and their use in creating shared knowledge frameworks. </li>
<li> Introduction to agent communication languages (e.g., KQML). </li>
<li> Ability to develop ontologies and implement inter-agent communication. </li>
</ul>

							<h4> Collaborative Discussion 2 : Initial Post </h4>
							<p> Introduction
In the field of intelligent systems, communication between agents is central to enabling cooperation and problem-solving. Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), such as KQML, emerged from artificial intelligence research to allow agents to share knowledge, intentions, and goals in a structured way(Gan Kim Soon et al., 2019). Unlike conventional programming approaches such as method invocation in Python or Java, ACLs emphasize autonomy and reasoning.


Advantages of Agent Communication Languages
Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), such as KQML, enable autonomous and intelligent agents to exchange not only data but also intentions, goals, and knowledge(Yannis Labrou, Finin and Peng, 1999). They support heterogeneous system integration by offering a standard protocol for communication. Based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model, ACLs allow agents to reason about messages and act accordingly, making them suitable for dynamic and distributed problem-solving contexts. For example, in logistics and supply chain networks, agents can negotiate delivery schedules or reroute shipments using ACLs(Hernandez, A.E. Fallah-Seghrouchni and Soldano, 2004). <br>

Disadvantages of Agent Communication Languages
Despite their strengths, ACLs face challenges. They introduce computational overhead because messages require interpretation and semantic consistency, unlike direct function calls. Additionally, ACLs depend on a shared ontology; if agents do not agree on definitions, misunderstandings arise(Mohsen Afsharchi, Far and Jörg Denzinger, 2006). This makes them more complex and less efficient than traditional approaches. Furthermore, debugging ACL-based systems is harder since communication involves abstract intentions rather than concrete instructions. <br>

Comparison with Method Invocation
Method invocation in Python or Java is procedural, direct, and efficient, where functions execute with predefined inputs and outputs(Cooper and Torczon, 2012). In contrast, ACLs are declarative and semantic, supporting autonomy and reasoning in loosely coupled environments. For tightly coupled enterprise systems, method invocation is faster and simpler. However, ACLs excel where flexibility, negotiation, and autonomy are required. <br>

Example
IBM’s early Knowledge Sharing Systems successfully employed KQML to integrate distributed intelligent agents(Anagnostopoulos, Lampropoulos and Sotiris Michalakos, 2005). In contrast, most e-commerce platforms rely on REST APIs and method invocation, since ACLs would add unnecessary complexity for straightforward service interactions.<br>

From my perspective, ACLs hold great promise in contexts where autonomy and reasoning are vital, but in practical industry settings, the simplicity of method invocation often makes it the preferred choice. <br>

Question For Discussion: How can future intelligent systems balance the autonomy of ACLs with the efficiency of traditional method invocation to achieve both scalability and performance? </p> <br>
